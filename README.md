Performance Enhancement of CPU Using New Geometry Heat Sinks
B.Tech Major Project

Developed and evaluated an innovative triangular honeycomb heat sink geometry aimed at improving the thermal management of CPUs. The design focused on increasing heat dissipation efficiency through enhanced surface area and airflow-induced turbulence, resulting in better convective heat transfer compared to conventional straight-fin heat sinks.

Utilized nTopology software for advanced CAD modeling of the complex honeycomb structure and conducted thermal simulations to analyze performance under various operating conditions. The heat sink was fabricated using metal 3D printing (SLM/DMLS), leveraging aluminumâ€™s high thermal conductivity. Experimental testing demonstrated significant improvements in heat dissipation, surface temperature uniformity, and reduced thermal resistance, making the design suitable for compact and high-performance computing applications.
